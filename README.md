Welcome to my fluency prediction experiment. 

The bulk of the project was done in MYoperator.py.
Every thing was done just by adding and commenting out code, so if you really want to reproduce everything I did, it could take a bit of editing. 

Feature extraction stuff was done in FEATURE_RANKING.py
